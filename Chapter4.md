The 4 students are running down a long and dark hallway.
Something is following them very closely behind.
Thump, thump, thump....
Is everyone here?
Its so dark, can you see anything?
Someone runs there fingers along the walls.
Click. Something clicks but no one heard it.
Its just a straight tunnel.
Wait, there is light ahead. 
Come on, lets get out of here!
They dash towards the light and breaks through.
Wait, where is this?
Thump, thump, thump...
They are stil being followed. 

The students run through campus, attempting to escape the Baby Doll. 
They decide to hide in the most confusing building on campus -- Olin Rice. 
Thinking that they were safe, the students let out a collective sign of relief. 
Unfortunately, Baby Doll appears in the hallway of Olin Rice. 
The 4 students begin to scream, running as fast as they can through the squared of hallways.
