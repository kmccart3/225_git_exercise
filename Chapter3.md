Chapter 3: The Nun

The main character is lying in bed. 
In the very corner of the room is a digital clock. 
The red light from the clock illuminates the shadows of books and clothes on the floor. 
Click. 
The clock ticks to 4:00AM now. 

The main character sighs heavily- still unable to sleep. 
Yesterday was so weird... they thought to themselves. 
I don't know if I should be worried... or scared. 
They rolled over on their back, heaving a heavy sigh.

The alarm clock starts ticking faster; noise starting to echo within the walls of the main character's bedroom. 

They sit upright, and the music stops. Then, all of a sudden, a dark figure grabs the shoulders of the character and pushes them down onto the bed. 
A nun's face, shadowed with dark red crimson blood hovers above the main character's head. 
The main character is speechless, thrashing about and unable to scream. The hands of the nun squeeze more and more into the shoulder as the character struggles. 

Blood seeps through the main character's pajamas, and they pass out.
