The baby doll knew it must continue to haunt the students.
The students had an outing planned.
After class, they were going to grab ice cream.
However, on the way to the ice cream store, they heard a cry in the distance.
They cry sounded shriveled but clear.
They looked at eachother concerned; it sounded like a baby.
They glanced up the nearby hill, and saw a nunery.
They all started running and wondering "Why was a baby crying at the nunery?"
When they got to the front doors of the nunery, they were wide open. 
They dashed inside, trying to find the noise, which seemed to be coming from above.
Up the tower they went, getting closer to the noise.
When they reached the door of the tower, they pushed it open and saw a figure standing there with its back to the door.
The figure was wearing the clothes of a nun. 
It turned around.
It's eyes were black.
It's skin was translucent.
It was holding the baby doll.
